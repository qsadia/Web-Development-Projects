			This is a picture of the Palace of Versailles which we visited on the 16th of July, 2015. We were amazed by the splendour, the extravagance, and the attention to detail inside the Palace. My favourite room was the Queen's bedchamber which was splendidly furnished and decorated. However, the Palace does not compare to the maginificence gardens of Versailles which are extensive, ambitious and beautiful.
